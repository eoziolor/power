# __Powerful Data Project__ Part II: Water cuts and drug testing

There is a lot of fuss about steroids! Many are proponents of _using them right_ and many say that they can cause _roid rage_, which presents as agression, unpredictability and backne...almost like being really hungry teenager with a temper. But the question that a lot of lifters like me have asked themselves is:

_Is taking steroids worth it?_

My opinion is that this is a very personal decision that anyone interested in strength or physique needs to make on their own. In the lifting world you will rarely find someone who hasn't had to make that decision at one point. Here's how I made mine:

When I was a kid, just starting to lift more seriously to lose some weight. As many, I started with bodybuilding and managed to lose 100+ lbs. At one point I hit a wall. It had been about 2-3 years into lifting and I was getting pretty good results. However, I wasn't improving as quickly anymore. I went to the owner of my hometown gym, long time family friend and also a former professional bodybuilder (now IFBB judge) and asked him if I should try anabolic steroids. I won't give you too much detail, but he diswayed me from that idea rather quickly. He made his strongest argument with a question: "Will you ever make bodybuilding your career?". I knew I wasn't and that led me to think for a while about what steroids would do for me. For myself, the pros did not outweigh the cons, they didn't even come close. So I never tried and I don't think I ever will...unless they get legalized after the government finally allows scientists to analyze their effects on the human body.

_Shameless plug for science_: Restricting scientists from testing products that are used worldwide and impact many lives is just stupid. Criminalizing steroid use is not stopping almost anybody from taking them and you will be surprised at the frequency of people, who don't necessarily look it like it, but still take steroids by the perscription of the local gym guru. Don't let Randy tell people what/how much/how often to take steroids...let scientists apply their methods and tell you what is "safe."

__MOVE IT ALONG, ELIAS__...I know. Let's get to the point of this article. Do steroids help you lift more weights??

The approach that I am taking here is the following: I will break down the dataset into two groups - lifters that compete in a federation that is drug tested and lifters that compete in a non-drug tested league. Several assumptions made here:

  + I will assume that drug tested federations only have drug-free athletes. This is definitely not always true. There have been lifters that admit to taking steroids, while they avoid detection, but that's a deeper issue that this dataset is not equipped at getting at. And those lifters are likely fewer than the majority that just wants to compete in a drug-free federation.
  
  + The newly created USPA drug-tested sub-federation is not clearly defined in this dataset, which is why I will lump those lifts with non-drug tested results. Since this has only happened in the last year or so, it is not likely to influence our results much.
  
  + I will assume that lifters in non-drug tested federations take steroids. This is definitely not always true, but there are a few reasons I am making this assumption: 1) If you weren't taking steroids and you think steroids make people stronger, you should probably be competing in a drug tested federation because that just puts you in a disadvantage. 2) there are likely more lifters that take steroids in non-drug tested federations than the ones that don't, so that will likely sway the data more to the true mean of enhanced lifters.

Let's take a look

### Disclaimer and info

* As always I want to remind you that I am just a scientist interested in parsing datasets, rather than one that can make experimental claims on this data. So take it or leave it.

* Data was downloaded on 7-23-18 from openpowerlifting.com/data

```

Obviously this is a fantastic and well kept dataset! __Great job__ openpowerlifting.com!

I want to draw your attention that there are so many columns in this dataset, each containing unique information about each lifter. This will give us a lot of power to draw some observations about patterns of skills and potentials of the lifters. First I want to start by breaking them up into age ranges. I don't like the ones drawn by more federations for my purposes. I want to have a bit higher resolution, so I will break them up into 5 year age gaps and see how things go from there.

I am also breaking them up into men and women for physiological reasons. I will be asking questions about max lift strength, so I don't want to obscure the findings for either of those groups.

  filter(!is.na(Age)) %>%

```

## Let's see how many leagues are represented and how frequently

```{r}
table(open2$Federation)
ord<-order(as.matrix(table(open2$Federation)),decreasing = TRUE)
feds<-as.matrix(table(open2$Federation))
feds[ord,]
```
That's pretty interesting, we have a good amount of federations. Now, openpowerlifting has included for us some fantastic data, so we can simply select drugtested vs. non-drug tested federation and compare the differences. Here I am making the big assumption: If the federation does not test for drugs, people likely take them; if federation tests for drugs, people likely don't. This is __absolutely__ an assumption. I will also only take federations that have >10000 entries as an arbitrary criterion. This will give the federation a bit of legitimacy, so that if they test, at least we know they have some structure to their testing.

```{r}
selectfeds<-filter(as.data.frame(table(open2$Federation)),Freq>10000)


open2_10k<-open2 %>%
  filter(Federation %in% selectfeds[,1])

drug<-open2_10k %>% 
  filter(Tested=="No")
natty<-open2_10k %>% 
  filter(Tested=="Yes")
dim(natty)[[1]]/dim(drug)[[1]]
```
What is really interesting is that there are about 4.5x more people competing in drug tested leagues than in non-drug tested leagues! Let's look at a distribution of the number of events happening in the different equipment types.

```{r}
equipd<-as.data.frame(table(drug$Equipment))
equipn<-as.data.frame(table(natty$Equipment))
equipd<-equipd[-4,]
equip<-cbind(equipd[,2],equipn[,2])
colnames(equip)<-c("drug","natty")
rownames(equip)<-equipd$Var1

equip_norm<-as.data.frame(cbind(as.factor(equipd$Var1),equip[,1]/sum(equip[,1]),equip[,2]/sum(equip[,2])))
equip_norm[,1]<-equipd$Var1
colnames(equip_norm)<-c("equipment","drug","natty")

equip2<-melt(equip_norm)

ggplot(equip2,
       aes(x=equipment,y=value,color=variable))+
  geom_point(aes(cex=3))+
  theme_classic()

```
So interestingly, the only category in which natty lifters are more abundant (and by far) is the single ply. These are corrected as proportions of total lifters that are in "natty" or "drug" leagues. I think it's about time to take a look at some weights. So I think the most informative category here would be to look at natty lifters. If you look proportionally, this is the moste equially distributed number, and also enough lifters to actually test some hypotheses.

```{r}
#men<-open2_10k %>%
  filter(Best3BenchKg>0 & Best3DeadliftKg>0 & Best3SquatKg>0) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Age)) %>%
  filter(Sex=="M") %>%
  filter(Equipment=="Raw") %>% 
  select(Equipment,Age,BodyweightKg,Best3SquatKg,Best3BenchKg,Best3DeadliftKg,TotalKg,Wilks,Group,Federation,Tested)

raw<-open2_10k %>% 
  filter(Best3BenchKg>0 & Best3DeadliftKg>0 & Best3SquatKg>0) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Age)) %>%
  filter(Equipment=="Raw") %>% 
  select(Equipment,Age,BodyweightKg,Best3SquatKg,Best3BenchKg,Best3DeadliftKg,TotalKg,Wilks,Group,Federation,Tested,Sex)

ggplot(raw,
       aes(x=BodyweightKg,y=TotalKg,color=Tested))+
  geom_point(cex=.1)+
  facet_wrap(.~Sex)+
  theme_classic()

ggplot(raw,
       aes(x=Group,y=TotalKg,fill=Tested))+
  geom_violin(trim=TRUE,scale="width")+
  facet_wrap(.~Sex)+
  theme_classic()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', message=FALSE}

       aes(x=Federation,y=TotalKg,fill=Federation))+
